        <h2>Gas station visits</h2>
        <p>Each point on the following graph depics a gas purchase at a gas
            station for a particular Toyota Corolla since the car's purchase.
            The overall trend shows approximately a fairly consistent usage of
            the car for driving distance (see the generally linear
            relationship) with some interesting deviations e.g. more driving
            through 2013 and a dip in driving distance from 2014 into the
            beginning of 2015.</p></div>

        <h2>Data source</h2>
        <p>When her car was purchased in April 2012, Celia implemented a
            system for tracking the gas station visits. Every visit was
            documented in a hand-written notebook in the glovebox with
            four data points: date, odometer reading, current gas cost in
            usd per gallons, and the number of gallons purchased. This data was
            digitally transcribed on Jan 26, 2018.</p></div>
